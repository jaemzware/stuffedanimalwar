```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Setting Up Endpoints

1. **Define endpoints** in `index.js`:
   ```javascript
   const stuffedAnimalWarEndpoints = ['jim', 'maddie', 'jacob', 'katie', 'mark', 'nina'];
   ```

2. **Create configuration files** for each endpoint:
   - Each endpoint needs a corresponding `{username}.json` file
   - Example: `maddie` endpoint requires `maddie.json`
   - If no custom `.json` file exists for an endpoint, `jim.json` is used as a fallback

### Configuration File Structure

Each `.json` file customizes the endpoint experience with multiple sections:

```json
{
   "endpoint": "maddie",
   "masterAlias": "MADDIE",
   "unspecifiedAlias": "anonymous",
   "stuffedAnimalMediaObject": {
      "backgroundimage": "https://example.com/background.jpg",
      "animals": [
         {
            "file": "https://example.com/bear.png",
            "title": "Bear"
         },
         {
            "file": "https://example.com/cat.png",
            "title": "Cat"
         }
      ]
   },
   "mediaObject": {
      "songspath": "https://example.com/audio/",
      "videospath": "https://example.com/videos/",
      "photospath": "https://example.com/images/",
      "songs": [
         {
            "file": "song1.mp3",
            "title": "My Favorite Song"
         }
      ],
      "videos": [
         {
            "file": "video1.mp4",
            "title": "Cool Video",
            "poster": "https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg"
         }
      ],
      "photos": [
         {
            "file": "photo1.jpg",
            "title": "Cool Photo"
         }
      ]
   },
   "responsesObject": {
      "responses": [
         {"response": "nice"},
         {"response": "that's cool"},
         {"response": "LOL"},
         {"response": "i know right"}
      ]
   }
}
```

### Configuration Sections

- **`endpoint`**: The URL endpoint name
- **`masterAlias`**: DJ name with special privileges (music control, chat/board clearing)
- **`unspecifiedAlias`**: Default name for anonymous users
- **`stuffedAnimalMediaObject`**: Game configuration with background and animal sprites
- **`mediaObject`**: Media library with base paths and file lists for songs, videos, photos
- **`responsesObject`**: Pre-defined chat responses for quick replies

## üé® Collaborative Drawing & Game Board

### Real-time Visual Collaboration
- **Freeform Drawing**: Draw freely on the game board with live stroke broadcasting to all users
- **Advanced Physics Engine**: Animals and bullets move with sine wave patterns, directional controls, and speed adjustments
- **Color Selection**: Each user can choose their own color for drawing lines and game elements
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Click any shared image thumbnail to instantly make it the canvas background
- **Multi-layered Interaction**: Combine drawings with game elements seamlessly
- **Mobile-Optimized Touch**: Responsive drawing with proper coordinate mapping and scroll prevention

### Game Mechanics
- **Animal Placement**: Add stuffed animals to the board from your custom collection
- **Bullet System**: Remove animals from the board using colored bullets with realistic collision detection
- **Hit Detection & Scoring**: Real-time collision detection between bullets and animals with point tracking
- **Color Coding**: All elements (animals, bullets, drawing lines) can be assigned colors for user identification
- **Movement Patterns**: Choose from directional movement, sine waves, or stationary placement
- **Speed Controls**: Adjustable speed settings for all moving elements
- **Real-time Updates**: Every action broadcasts instantly to all connected users

### Creative Features
- **Persistent Canvas**: Drawings and game state remain until manually cleared or server restart
- **Collaborative Art**: Multiple users drawing simultaneously with different colors
- **Interactive Annotations**: Draw over shared photos, diagrams, or any uploaded image
- **Live File Broadcasting**: Upload images/videos with progress tracking that instantly appear for all users
- **MP3 Metadata Integration**: Automatic song information, album art, and track display
- **Visual Communication**: Express ideas through both structured game elements and freeform drawing

## üéÆ How It Works

### Socket Events

**Chat Events**: `{endpoint}chatmessage`
- Broadcasts chat messages, media URLs, and DJ commands
- Example: `maddiechatmessage` for the 'maddie' endpoint

**Game Events**: `{endpoint}tapmessage`
- Handles game interactions: animal placement, bullet firing, color changes
- Broadcasts real-time drawing paths with color information as users draw
- Updates dynamic background changes when images are selected
- Manages game board state including animal positions and bullet interactions
- Example: `maddietapmessage` for the 'maddie' endpoint

### DJ Privileges

Users with the configured `masterAlias` can:
- **Synchronized multi-device audio**: Control music across all connected devices simultaneously
- Change music for all connected clients by selecting songs or pasting MP3 URLs in chat
- Clear the chat for everyone
- Reset the game board
- Create makeshift stereo systems using phones, tablets, computers, and Bluetooth speakers

**Party Audio Setup**: Connect multiple devices around your space (phones on Bluetooth speakers, tablets, laptops) to the same endpoint. The DJ can change songs and all devices will switch tracks simultaneously, creating a multi-room audio experience without expensive hardware.

**Network Diagnostics**: The synchronized audio playback can help identify network latency differences between devices - slower devices or those with poor connections will exhibit noticeable audio delay, providing an intuitive way to assess your local network performance.

### Privacy Features

- **No data persistence**: Messages and media exist only during active sessions
- **Memory-only storage**: All game states and chat history cleared on server restart
- **No user registration**: Access endpoints directly without accounts
- **No logging**: No chat logs, user tracking, or analytics

## üîß Use Cases

### **Offline Social Hub**
- **House parties**: Set up a Pi, everyone connects and shares music/photos instantly
- **Camping/retreats**: Create a local network for group communication without cell service
- **Classrooms**: Teacher-controlled environment for collaborative activities
- **Events**: Pop-up social spaces at conferences, festivals, or gatherings

### **Privacy-Focused Communication**
- **Sensitive discussions**: Everything disappears when the session ends
- **Family gatherings**: Share photos and memories without cloud storage
- **Creative collaboration**: Draw and annotate together without saving artwork
- **Small communities**: Neighborhood or friend group communication
- **Development/testing**: Safe environment for testing social features

### **Gaming & Entertainment**
- **Game nights**: Combine digital interaction with physical gatherings
- **Strategy games**: Place animals and use bullets in colorful tactical battles
- **Creative workshops**: Collaborative drawing and art sessions on shared canvases
- **Brainstorming sessions**: Draw diagrams, mind maps, and ideas together in real-time
- **Team building**: Interactive group activities with color-coded participation
- **Art collaboration**: Multiple people drawing on the same canvas simultaneously with different colors

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

This platform is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Ephemeral by design**: All data exists only in memory during sessions
- **No databases**: Zero persistent storage of any user content
- **No tracking**: No user analytics, cookies, or behavioral tracking
- **Offline capable**: Works completely without internet connectivity
- **Local network only**: Can be isolated from external networks entirely
- **Decentralized**: Host your own instance for complete control
- **Open source**: Full transparency of data handling practices
